# ## Step 1: get the data
# 
# The Boston dataset contains data on median house price for houses in the Boston area. The variable that we’ll try to predict is the medv variable (median house price). The dataset has roughly a dozen other predictors that we’ll be investigating and using in our model.
# 
# This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It was obtained from the StatLib archive (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston), and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. However, these comparisons were primarily done outside of Delve and are thus somewhat suspect. The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases.
# 
# The data was originally published by *Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.'*
# 
# The name for this dataset is simply boston. It has two prototasks: **NOX**, in which the nitrous oxide level is to be predicted; and *MEDV*, in which the median value of a home is to be predicted (MEDV has been renamed to target, int the following code)
# 
# 
# There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:
# * CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
# * ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
# * INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
# * CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
# * NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
# * RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
# * AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
# * DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
# * RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
# * TAX - full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000
# * PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
# * B - $1000(Bk - 0.63)^2$ where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
# * LSTAT - percentage of lower status of the population
# * MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000's

# As I already mentioned, the example we’ll be working through is a bit of a “toy” example, and as such, we’re working with a dataset that’s relatively “easy to use.” What I mean is that I’ve chosen this dataset because it’s easy to obtain and it doesn’t require much data cleaning.
# 
# However, keep in mind that in a typical business or industry setting, you’ll probably need to get your data from a database using SQL or possibly from a spreadsheet or other file.
# 
# Moreover, it’s very common for data to be “messy.” The data may have lots of missing values; variable names and class names that need to be changed; or other details that need to be altered.
# 
# To start, each column must have its type correctly assigned.

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 2: basic data exploration
# 
# After getting the dataset, the next step in the model building workflow is almost always data visualization. Specifically, we’ll perform exploratory data analysis on the data to accomplish several tasks:
# 
# 1. Missing value
# 1. View data distributions
# 1. Identify outliers
# 1. Check correlation between features
# %% [markdown]
# ### Missing value
# 
# Handling missing data is important as many machine learning algorithms do not support data with missing values. There are two main approaches:
# 
# * Delete rows with missing values :
# * Imput (i.e. replace) missing values with sensible values.
# 
# You will find [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handle-missing-data-python/) a tutorial that presents these two approaches and gives indications on how to handle missing values

# %%
# Is there some missing value ?
data_boston.isnull().sum()

# %% [markdown]
# In this dataset, there are no missing values. So nothing to do.
# %% [markdown]
# ### View data distribution
# 
# Let's begin our exploration of the data by visualizing the distributions of the data. Many things are possible. The code below details a simple but not complete first approach. The two following tutorials, complete the given examples.
# 
# * [A Gentle Introduction to Data Visualization Methods in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-visualization-methods-in-python/), describes the main functions of matplotlib
# * [How to use Seaborn Data Visualization for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/seaborn-data-visualization-for-machine-learning/), describes the main functions of seaborn
# 
# In the following, we will mainly use the functions integrated in Pandas. We start by visualizing the distribution of our target variable.
# 
# To do this, we will first use a basic histogram and then plot a density. The density plot is essentially a variation of the histogram.

# %%
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

data_boston['target'].plot.hist(bins=5, ax=axes[0]) # Try to change bins number
data_boston['target'].plot.kde(ax=axes[1]);

# %% [markdown]
# Let’s examine the plots. We can immediately see a few important details:
# 
# 1. It’s not perfectly normal. This is one of the things we’re looking for when we visualize our data (particularly for linear regression). I’ll save a complete explanation of why we test for normality in linear regression and machine learning, but in brief, we are examining this because many machine learning techniques require normally distributed variables.
# 
# 2. It appears that there may be a few minor outliers in the far right tail of the distribution. For the sake of simplicity, we’re not going to deal with those outliers here; we’ll be able to build a model (imperfect though it might be) without worrying about those outliers right now.
# %% [markdown]
# Between histograms and density plots, some people strongly prefer histograms. The primary reason for this is that histograms tend to “provide better information on the exact location of data” (which is good for detecting outliers). This is true in particular when you use a relatively larger number of histogram bins; a histogram with a sufficiently large number of bins can show you peaks and unusual data details a little better, because it doesn’t smooth that information away. Histograms with a small number of bins can smooth that information out too much. **So, when we’re visualizing a single variable, the histogram might be the better option.**
# %% [markdown]
# However, when we’re visualizing multiple variables at a time, density plots are easier to work with. If you attempt to plot several histograms at the same time by using a small multiple chart, it can be very difficult to select a single binwidth that properly displays all of your variables. Because of this, density plots are easier to work with when you’re visualizing multiple variables in a small multiple chart. **Density plots show the general shape of the data and we don’t have to worry about choosing the number of bins.**

# %%
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(12,4))


data_boston[['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS']].plot.hist(bins=5, ax=axes[0]) # Try to change bins number
data_boston[['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS']].plot.kde(ax=axes[1]);

# %% [markdown]
# It is also possible to display a very large number of variables in different plots in order to watch:
# 
# 1. Outliers
# 2. Skewness
# 3. Other deviations from normality

# %%
data_boston.plot.kde(subplots=True, sharex=False, layout=(4,4), figsize=(15,9));


# %%
numeric_features = [f for f, t in zip(data_boston.columns, data_boston.dtypes) if t in ['float64', 'int32']]
data_boston[numeric_features].hist(layout=(4,4), bins=10, xlabelsize=8, ylabelsize=8, figsize=(15,9));

# %% [markdown]
# ### Identify outlier
# 
# The presence of outliers in a classification or regression dataset can result in a poor fit and lower predictive modeling performance.
# 
# Identifying and removing outliers is challenging with simple statistical methods for most machine learning datasets given the large number of input variables. Instead, automatic outlier detection methods can be used in the modeling pipeline and compared, just like other data preparation transforms that may be applied to the dataset.
# 
# In this [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/model-based-outlier-detection-and-removal-in-python/), you will discover different techniques to automatically identify outliers. Since we don't have all the tools yet, we will proceed more simply.
# 
# * We will display the numerical features and see which ones have very few outliers or explainable values.
# * Then we will remove the values that we think are outliers
# 

# %%

    sns.pairplot(data=data_boston,
                x_vars=data_boston.columns[i:i+5],
                y_vars=['target'])

# %% [markdown]
# In the absence of a statistical measurement tool, it is quite difficult to identify outliers.
# 
# * We can easily see that prices above 50 have been reduced to this value (target variable) -> We could therefore decide to delete the observations that have prices equal to this value

# %%

for i in range(0, len(data_boston_cleaned.columns), 5):

                x_vars=data_boston_cleaned.columns[i:i+5],
                y_vars=['target'])

# %% [markdown]
# ###  Check correlation between features
# 
# There may be complex and unknown relationships between the variables in your dataset.
# 
# It is important to discover and quantify the degree to which variables in your dataset are dependent upon each other. This knowledge can help you better prepare your data to meet the expectations of machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, whose performance will degrade with the presence of these interdependencies.
# 
# It's possible to plot the correlation between features and target using pandas correlation function and sns to lot the result.
# 
# This [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-use-correlation-to-understand-the-relationship-between-variables/) gives more information.

# %%
sns.heatmap(data_boston_cleaned.corr().abs());

# %% [markdown]
# We will try to find which features are strongly correlated with the target

# %%
df_num_corr = data_boston_cleaned.corr()['target'][:-1] # -1 because the latest row is our target
golden_features_list = df_num_corr[abs(df_num_corr) > 0.5].sort_values(ascending=False)
print("There is {} strongly correlated values with the target:\n{}".format(len(golden_features_list), golden_features_list))

# %% [markdown]
# We can now visualize these features. As these data are highly correlated with the target, they should have an important weight when building the model.

# %%
sns.pairplot(data=data_boston_cleaned,
                x_vars=golden_features_list.index,
                y_vars=['target']);

# %% [markdown]
# ## Prepare dataset
# 
# There are standard workflows in a machine learning project that can be automated.
# 
# In Python scikit-learn, Pipelines help to to clearly define and automate these workflows.
# 
# Pipelines work by allowing for a linear sequence of data transforms to be chained together culminating in a modeling process that can be evaluated.
# 
# The goal is to ensure that all of the steps in the pipeline are constrained to the data available for the evaluation, such as the training dataset or each fold of the cross validation procedure.
# 
# You can learn more about Pipelines in scikit-learn by reading the [Pipeline section](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html) of the user guide. You can also review the API documentation for the [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) and [FeatureUnion](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion.html) classes in the pipeline module.
# 
# The main steps are:
# 
# - Split the dataset into a train part and a test part
# - normalize or binarize the numerical features
# - ordinal encode nominal categorical features for which it is desirable to keep the order 
# - one hot encode the remaining features
# %% [markdown]
# ### Split the dataset
# 
# The train-test split is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning algorithm.
# 
# It can be used for classification or regression problems and can be used for any supervised learning algorithm.
# 
# The procedure involves taking a dataset and dividing it into two subsets. The first subset is used to fit the model and is referred to as the training dataset. The second subset is not used to train the model; instead, the input element of the dataset is provided to the model, then predictions are made and compared to the expected values. This second dataset is referred to as the test dataset.
# 
# * **Train Dataset:** Used to fit the machine learning model.
# * **Test Dataset:** Used to evaluate the fit machine learning model.
# 
# The objective is to estimate the performance of the machine learning model on new data: data not used to train the model or to find best hyper-parameters.
