**Title**: 3D Human Pose Estimation in Videos

**Contact**: Frédéric Precioso, frederic.precioso@univ-cotedazur.fr

**Description**:  

The estimation of human poses, i.e., of every joint of every visible human, in a 3D space inferred from a 2D monocular videos is a challenging task and an intense area of research in computer vision. The challenges are number of humans, poses, occlusions, camera pose and motion, defocus, blur and partial body parts [1,2]. This project consists in

(1) studying major recent results in this domain, implementing and testing the frameworks of [3,4,5,6] on the original datasets, and

(2) if time permits, on a new film dataset [2] on which artistic shots make the task challenging.

This TER lies in the framework of the ANR TRACTIVE project (https://www.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/TRACTIVE/).
