## Introduction

- The project is an opportunity to develop organizational skills and autonomy.
- The subjects of research projects are deliberately complicated, and require, on the one hand, the
mobilization of the skills acquired during the Master cycle and, on the other hand, the search for
new knowledge.
- The work carried out must be able to position itself in relation to existing work, whether in
relation to a scientific state of the art or to a comparative study of similar tools/solutions.

You will be evaluated on the basis of a scientific article you have written. This article must have at least 2 parts:
- a state of the art i.e. a synthesis of 2 to 4 papers selected by the proposer
- the highlighting of a research project based on the previous state of the art i.e. the definition of the first experiments to fill a gap in the state of the art or to use the state of the art to solve a new problem.

You are expected to be expressive and creative. One day per week is dedicated to this research project, as well as two weeks full-time.
Only the final report and the defense are evaluated.

## Projects details

**Title**: 3D Human Pose Estimation in Videos

**Contact**: Frédéric Precioso, frederic.precioso@univ-cotedazur.fr

**Description**:  

The estimation of human poses, i.e., of every joint of every visible human, in a 3D space inferred from a 2D monocular videos is a challenging task and an intense area of research in computer vision. The challenges are number of humans, poses, occlusions, camera pose and motion, defocus, blur and partial body parts [1,2]. This project consists in

(1) studying major recent results in this domain, implementing and testing the frameworks of [3,4,5,6] on the original datasets, and

(2) if time permits, on a new film dataset [2] on which artistic shots make the task challenging.

This TER lies in the framework of the ANR TRACTIVE project (https://www.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/TRACTIVE/).

### Deadlines
- State of the Art (5-8 pages): November 30
- Full project (8-12 pages): February 15
- Oral presentation: Last week of February
