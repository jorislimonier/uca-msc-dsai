She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at.

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",fa87afa7d-1.jpg,Terrier,True

Luckily for the puppy he managed to dodge the in coming car just in time. The puppy was so shaken and i decided to bring him home for temporary care, he was so hungry that he finish up all the food in just seconds and of course after the meal it was time to take a good and nice hot bath.

Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around.

Cat,36.0,Male,Black,Gray,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"Mr CrankyPants is one of the cats in a feral colony that my neighbor and I care for. Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury.

It all started at 25th December . A beagle was found resting under a tree near my garage.He was thirsty and hungry.Realizing it was a pure breed Beagle that could probably be someone else's pet,I temporarily adopted the beagle.However,my own dogs didn't seemed to welcomed him as much as we do by barking at beagle most of the time.So,our neighbour adopted the beagle as they seemed to like the beagle so much.Unfortunately,this wasn't the truth.The neighbour had been very irresponsible by letting the beagle to wander around the streets even on heavy rainy days.Desperated,I asked for explaination and requested that the beagle deserves a better owner.The neighbour didn't seemed to feel sorry about their actions and blamed it on the poor beagle.It had only been a week since they adopted the beagle and we can see significant loss of weight in the beagle.However,they gave an excuse that someone in their family will soon be home to take care the beagle.we decided to give them one last chance to repay what they had done but Unfortunately it turns out to be just another wrong decision.This time,the excuse is that the family member which is responsible for taking care of the beagle is leaving Malaysia soon and...=.= Never ending... BUT... they finally gave in when i requested to get the beagle a Good owner again today-4th january . So right now i'm searching for a good, responsible, loving, and patient owner for this beagle. Having a pet is like caring a baby,Not just another plush toy! So,feel free to contact me if you are ready to give your best and you will certainly be surprised by what you would get from this little beagle!! ^0^ Sincerely, Silver Star",470e49e41-5.jpg,Beagle,False

The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain.

Maksim is extremely vocal and knows how to talk (meow) back when spoken to. :) ♥ Maksim LOVES being carried over his people's shoulders (he stays put like a parrot and simply enjoys the view he gets). Maksim will also run right over to your lap whenever he's spooked by something (still doesn't stop him from exploring every nook and cranny he can find!) ♥ This boy can be a little demanding when he taps into his manja-moods (asking for cheek-rubs and strokes while he snoozes off). Mind you he has a VERY loud purr! ♥ Maksim is healthy, has been de-wormed (once) and given Frontline (flea medication). Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Whenever alone, Maksim tries to ""play"" with our fingers during stroking, and sometimes nips.

( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. (I MAY ask for the deposit of first year vaccination and will return once you have vaccinated the kitten with proof. I may or may not. However you are required to inquire at your preferred clinic and inform me on the vaccination amount.

She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten.

My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. ♥ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions.

The scrawny little tyke was skin and bones. He pulled at my friend's heartstrings and she bundled him up in a box to bring to me for fostering. He had a fungal infection and this had made him lose a lot of hair. After weeks of treatment most of it has grown back and he now has a lovely striped orange tabby coat and an elegant long tail. He is long limbed and lean. A white patch on his chest is the extra touch of cuteness that makes him irresistible. Personality-wise, he is very affectionate and playful. He loves attention and cuddles from both humans and other cats alike. Mischevious, he can often be found wrestling with my other cats or stealing food from my dog. Tom loves attention and doesn't like to be alone. It would be great if he could find a home with other cats or perhaps a dog. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tom are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption.

We will not be contacting you unless you have answered the points stated so that it helps us to screen through prospective adopters. A male Beagle was found wandering near Klang Parade on December 27. He was found without collar. He has been rescued and handed over to us to foster. We have named him Tristan. However, after fostering him for months, no one claims to be the owner. Hence, he is now up for adoption. Blood test, health check has been done and he is healthy except for yeast infection on legs - which require good diet and a hint of apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil daily to slowly recover. He is friendly, playful and gentle. He barks and bays at times when he wants to be near humans. Please note that Beagles shed, can be very loud when barking, and can be quite stubborn. If you are ready to give him a good home, please contact us and provide us with details on: 1. Your experience handling dogs. 2. The environment you can provide him with. 3. How much time can you spend with him. 4. What diet will you be feeding him. Thank you.",3d8a35224-4.jpg,Beagle,False

He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets.

Dog,5.0,Female,Black,Brown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,No,Healthy,550.0,"********** NEW Update ********** C’mie, the lost dog from Padang Merbok / Bukit Tunku is now available for adoption. My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",6469a2a4a-5.jpg,German_Shepherd_Dog,True

Now we are moving abroad and out of our three dogs we can only take one with us. Therefore we are looking for a loving home for her. With her shiny black coat she looks quite impressive, but she is a gentle creature when it comes to people. We have always felt very safe with her around. Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she ""convinced"" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long. Staying alone during the day has never been a problem We really hope that there is someone out there who will take her in (maybe even together with Rosie) and give her the life she deserves",8b2be8807-4.jpg,Golden_Retriever,True

Today, after a few rounds of Whiskas kitten food, a bath and a clean environment, she is bright-eyed and stronger; plays like any normal kitten. She is unafraid of people and loves nothing more than to be with people. She is now toilet-trained on a sandbox. She also does not meow very much, behaves like an intelligent kitten instead of an annoying howler, loves to be petted, purrs an awful lot. Nobody has come forward to claim her, and efforts to find a home for her on FB is still fruitless. Tiggy will be an easy cat to care for, as she is independent yet loving, toilet trained and quite neat. She needs some love and attention, responsible owners who will neuter her and give her the security and care she deserves. I will only be in Malaysia for a few weeks, so am now URGENTLY looking - and hoping - for a home for Tiggy. She deserves better than to be a street cat, left to die or get run over. Please help Tiggy, she will be a lovable companion.",62b2ac9fd-1.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,True

There were only 2 remaining when I tried to get them adopted through Petfinder but failed for months as they were highly afraid of humans and fled into an opening whenever I tried to get closer, probably due to the constant abuse, threats and beatings from the restaurant workers. I could always hear them crying out in pain/fear from my home. Sadly I believe her brother was bludgeoned to death. There was nothing I could do until one day during a heavy downpour which flooded her place of refuge, I found her at my doorstep. We have been fostering her and can finally post her up for adoption after 2 weeks of getting her to trust and adapt to humans. She is still cautious and slightly fearful but we managed to give her a bath and continue building her confidence. Hope to find her a good home soon so she can be loved and cared for.

Abandoned there as a puppy with her mom (who died when she was knocked down by a car), Snow has been roaming the streets on her own. She is gentle in nature, loves affection, and would be a good indoor/outdoor dog. Smart and trainable! Ideal home would give her plenty of freedom to move around in the house compound or indoors, take her for regular walks and provide heart worm prevention. Snow will be a great companion for other dogs! She can play with younger ones, and at the same time gentle and mild mannered enough for old dogs too! Photos don't do her justice! Come view her and fall in love with this sweet girl. Snow has been spayed on 17 August , and has received her first vaccination too! Potential adopter is expected to consent to a house check (to ensure the place is proper and suitable for keeping a pet) and also send us updates on how she's doing. No fees will be charged for the adoption, though should the new family want to reimburse the neutering fees, that would be welcomed, or just pay it forward by contributing any amount to your favourite animal shelter or TNRM efforts.",48553ec94-4.jpg,Mixed_Breed,True

Dog,7.0,Female,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Small,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"Estee is part of a trio of puppies born to a pair of stray dogs near our house. Her sister was killed by a car a few months ago while her brother suddenly disappeared one day. When we rescued Estee, she was very sick. The vet said she had blood parasite and if we were one day late in rescuing her, she would have died. Estee was put on antibiotics and was in and out of the vet's office for almost 3 months because her condition kept fluctuating. One day she was fine and the next day she will fall sick. We worked hard to make sure she is tick free, flea free and everything free. And we also make sure she eats her food so that she can build up her immune system. Finally in early August , the vet gave Estee a clean bill of health. Estee has, at last, fully recovered from her illness. As long as she doesn't have any ticks, fleas or parasites and she eats proper nutritious meals, the vet said she will be fine. Estee is now a bundle of energy with a real zest for life. Estee is very easy to handle. She is what we call a follower. Estee is a very affectionate puppy and she loves to give her humans kisses. She thrives when she is showered with love and she is not afraid to show her love to us. Estee prefers to do her small business outside but if it is raining or in the middle of the night, she will do it in the potty we provided for her at the car porch. But, she insists on doing her big business outside. At the moment, Estee stands at about 1 foot tall standing on four legs and less than 2 feet in length from the tip of her nose to the tip of her very, very short tail. Estee should be quite small fully grown because her parents are small dogs. Her mother is slightly bigger than a fully grown male cat while her father is only about 1.5 feet in height. Her fur is one glossy black coat. And yes, her ears are as per her picture - one standing upright and the other flopping down. But when she is in alert mode, both ears will be upright. Estee is now learning to bark at strangers that come up to our gate. She will make a good house pet. She is quite good with children too.",950dd345b-6.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add ""well traveled"" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him.

Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥",d8715d47e-4.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False

That wound is fully healed but recently we just found out there's red spot spotted under it ball which is diff area than his previous wound.

Cat,2.0,Female,Black,Yellow,White,Small,Yes,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Hello. Meet Tookins, who reinvents herself from a traumatised stray to a techno savvy kitten. She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message.

Due to physical and time constraints, I have had to make the hard decision of letting Kyra go. I've only had her for about four months, but due to a serious leg injury, I'm unable to give her the attention that she deserves. KYRA was a shop dog in horrid condition. She had bad teeth, bad claws, and horrible skin. Even so, she is a bubbly, energetic pup with so much love to give. She is a high energy, bouncy dog, and quite simple in the head in terms of the way she plays. Kyra knows how to SIT, LIE DOWN, and knows how to wait for her meals. She has been treated for heartworm, dewormed, and had extensive treatment for a serious case of demodex.

Cat,8.0,Male,Black,White,Unknown,Medium,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"(Urgent) This boy lives in the garage of my condo. I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him. I am not getting him out of the streets to have him get back there in a few years.",b631b7e4a-4.jpg,Siamese,True

His fur coat is short and longer at some parts, grooming is easy as the fur is not fine hairs, so an occasional brush through will be good for him.  17/1/17 - Goofy is still waiting for his FURever home UPDAT /17 - GOOFY is still living in the dog shelter together with dogs. He is confined in his own enclosure (no worries there is a good amount of space) & he always crave for human attention. When it rains, his enclosure will get wet :( UPDAT /17 - Goofy is still waiting for his furever home. Do you think he will be part of your family? Contact me for more enquiries.

So hoping somebody kind and good, care to adopt him.For your info, I sometime let putih out from cage and locked Kiko in one of my room, cause Putih seem like unsecure and ready to attack Kiko if he see Kiko and of cause Kiko will try to protect himself. I cannot keep up with this anymore because I need to search for a job myself,my life and my husband,cause i am not employed for a moment, and will have to search for work soon,so I really need to settle ""Putih"" problem as soon as possible. p/s:(already adopted by welee lee.

She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family .

Cat,18.0,Male,Gray,White,Unknown,Large,No,No,No,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"This handsome fluffy guy walked into a food stall and was very friendly and very hunger. We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves.

According to the people around, he has been there for 2-3 days. We rushed Eaton to the nearby vet where he was given intensive care. As a result of the ties, there are ligature marks on all his four legs. Eaton is now recovering and we are seeking for animal lover to open their heart for Eaton. Eaton is timid due to the way he was treated. Once he gained your trust, he will be your best buddy. We are not charging any adoption fee as all we hope is for the adopter to care and love Eaton. Goodwill donation is welcomed to ease our medical fee burden. To qualify you to own Eaton, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. If you are below 18 years old, we will require your parents to speak with us on the adoption procedure. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 4) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 5) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive her progress update. 6) During the intial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Eaton is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 7) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Eaton cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. 8) We reserve all rights to remove Eaton from you if he is found to be neglected under your care.

Dog,24.0,Male,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"Jack Jack, once had a so-called home. His owner is my neighbouring factory. I have rescued him twice & this is the third. I did try to talk to his owner, apparently she won't take my advice seriously. Jack Jack feds on human ta pau food. Three times a week. That's right, ONLY 3x a week. He often comes to me for food, water & doggie snack. Of course I will give it to him without his owner knowing. Bear in mind, not every owner likes their dog to be fed by ""strangers"". Anything could happen to their dog & blame will be on the ""strangers"". Jack Jack will be left outside at night after everyone went back. He couldn't find a good spot if it rains at night. Few days, I haven't seen Jack Jack. I went looking for him in his cage. He was too weak to walk & wag his tail. Then I found out there's a hole in his back with maggots! Took me 3 days to gain his trust in order for me to ""trap"" him! Made it! He has recovered from his wound (picture shown) Ok, somehow he is making himself comfortable staying in my regular vet! Food, water, love, care. Away from scoring sunshine & rain. What he needs now is a good home. I can't put him back to where he once belonged. This is why: His owner apparently ask me ""have you seen [that] dog?"" To that I replied her, ""He's dead."" And she goes, ""oh.. ok."" She didn't even bother to ask what has happened, why... I'm not seeking a thank you from her but this makes me feeling more sad & pity for Jack Jack. Oh yes, he responds to this name given by me. And yes, he has no name with his previous owner. So, there you have it, I can't bring Jack Jack ""back to life"". But I hope to find a good home for him :)",b780980c1-5.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

We're cooperated with some vet clinics to get discount medical fees for adopted pets. Little Pudding is looking for a home sweet home! Pudding is a cute, sweet and friendly dog, she's not those very naughty type of pup and most of the time she can play by her own and she do not really like to play with other dogs. Pudding was found days ago beside a huge rubbish bins and was hiding under an abandoned sofa, was barking fiercely to us out of fear. We heard from the residents there that she was there for three days and some kind hearted kids there offered her some foods and drinks. We strongly feel that she was being ABANDONED there as we've already spayed all the female street dogs around that area and there's no newcoming mommy dog, and Pudding stayed at that area for three days without moving to other places to look for foods (there's no coffee shop near to her) and apparently she's waiting for someone. Pudding found with lots of fleas, tangled hair and some minor wounds. We've defleas her, do her some simple grooming and treat her wound. But after fostering her for days we found a weird behavior of Pudding - she used to pee and poo inside the cage even when the door of the cage is opened and even after a long time of playing time at the garden, and she can stay really quiet inside the cage unlike other puppy who do not like to be caged. We strongly suspect again that she was being caged all the time before she was being abandoned. What kind of life she was having previously? We really can't imagine that. And so we must find a owner who really love her, and also patient enough to correct her toilet manner. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pudding ♥",4e290a43a-9.jpg,Mixed_Breed,True

My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",01ac09f2a-1.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False

In october she was found with an injured leg, so we took her to the veterinary. Her leg is healed very well, she now just has to build up leg muscles again, because she did not use this leg for about 2 weeks - best way to train is to play ;) She is well socialized: - loves humans: loves to be petted, likes to give kisses nose to nose, is cuddling and talking - very patient (had to take a lot of medicines and still loves me ;) - not afraid of noises - using litter box perfectly We can not keep her, so we needed to put her back in the compound, when the leg had healed. Update 6th Nov : Bobo has developed some skin problems, it turned out to be a fungus called ""ringworm"". She is treated with medicine against it. Bobo received her first vacination yesterday. She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then... Update .16 Bobo definitly lost weight - she has grown so nice under our care :( Maybe loss of appetite because of medicine or she does not get enough food...she is the smallest cat around! Still hoping to be adopted... Update 17th November: The skinproblems are gone XD, hair is growing back very fast! She needs to take pills for 6 more days and get powdered 2 more weeks to really get rid of the fungus. Great recovery, tough girl! She is always around the guardhouse, when I visit. As well as her sister, a beauty in white and orange (see photo below and further profile). She is always coming to me too :). They are very different in character, but I think they are a good couple! Can be adopted together ;) Both are so friendly, bonded to humans and love to be petted! But definivly too skinny... I hope to find a serious adopter who will give her a nice home, love and a healthy life with good cat food, prevention of ticks, fleas and worms, medical attention if needed in future and after all a friend to play with!

He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house.

He has been with us for 1 month and his wound has healed. I don't know if all the fur will grow back. He has a lovely disposition, and runs to you when he's called. Looking for human who's ready for a committed mutual companionship. 4. She makes a more pleasant and compatible companion than many humans out there! NOTE: She is still a cat - hence, do not leave food unattended. She goes into her cage on her own to sleep. Now that she's at PAWS the new owner can refresh her memory by training her to go to her cage and sit before putting her food down. She has already adapted very well with human house rules. Watch her videos! Call Fosterer Mimi As of Mon Nov 4, I have to give her up to PAWS for good at Subang because I will be away and there's no one home.",2cde24ccc-1.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False

However, due to shortage of place to keep them, Coffee and his brother Milo had to be released to the food court after visit to the vet. The heavy traffic and unfriendly human around is not a safe place for these sweet pups. We pray for the kind person to give this poor kid a real home before it's too late... If you are able to help by adopting or fostering, please contact Sandy via whatsapp / sms / phone The brothers are very close, while single adoption are welcome, if you can keep both of them would be much appreciated :) and here's Coffee's brother - Milo",a05c489dc-6.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

Dog,8.0,Male,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,120.0,"[Adopted 17 November by Lawrence T] ""I'm a cute young standard English bull terrier with lots of love to give. I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently. I have a major, MAJOR oral fixation and will chew anything and everything I can get my pearly white chompers on so I hope you'll be patient with me, pretty please? Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself including location - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :) SERIOUS ENQUIRIES ONLY. To prove that you have read and understood the listing including the information I have requested, please include this in the body of your email: ""I have read Chabee's listing properly and am fully aware of his issue with destructive chewing. Despite this, I am prepared to prevent or manage such behaviour."" Emails that do not provide info requested will not be entertained.",c7e8a87dc-8.jpg,Bull_Terrier,True

At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here.

Cat,2.0,Female,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"I found May (on 6th May ) outside a sundry shop, alone and tiny with no siblings or mum cat around. She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC!

Valentine is a bold, lively, playful little boy who loves to snuggle and play with his toy. He is very sweet and affectionate with a lovely stripey coat - very attractive. He is fine with other cats - wants to play with my existing cats (unfortunately they don't want to play with him!). Valentine has received 2 vaccinations and will receive his final vaccination and spaying operation within the next week. He was originally adopted from me as a small kitten (see original photos) but the owner has changed jobs and Valentine has been returned to me. He is now looking for his forever home - I am looking for someone who can commit to caring for him for the rest of his life (>18 years potentially) so please think carefully before making a commitment. Adopter requirements: Valentine will probably be fine in a household with other cats (assuming they are OK with him of course!) but he needs to have individual attention to stay occupied so not suitable for a household with many other animals. He is very bold and affectionate so I think would also be good with children.

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days.

Cat,1.0,Female,Golden,Cream,White,Medium,No,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Introducing little miracle, Kiseki! ♥ Six weeks old, plush-coated Ginger (yes, a female Ginger!) with beautiful hazel eyes. ♥ Kiseki is a fighter and one tough girl! She was rescued from a monsoon drain and later brought to the vets: where she was dewormed, prescribed meds and finally administered Frontline spray. Kiseki had a very bad (and rare) reaction to the (by label very safe) Frontline spray - which sent her into neurological convulsions. She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system. She's now in back great shape and one of the most rambunctiously happy kittens you'll ever see! ♥ Kiseki seeks a home where she will be well cared for and her fighting spirit truly appreciated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Character details: ♥ Kiseki is an avid explorer, she's quick to adjust to new situations and loves loves LOVES to play! Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls. She has been great so far at entertaining herself (and us with her antics) despite being a single foster kitten. ♥ Being rescued really young, Kiseki is also extremely human-affectionate. She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for her long term well being (please inquire). Drop me a text (WhatsApp) or call directly (preferred) if you feel that you may be just the right person to give Kiseki a good home.

The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human.

I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end.

A nice lady found me in Nilam Terraces in Puchong sometime in end April. She asked the neighbourhood guards about me but no one knew who I belonged to and the guards said I'd been wandering around for 2 weeks. The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me. So my carer who has a fondness for anime decided to call me Chibi (""small"" in Japanese) and help me look for a new home. I may be small in stature (only 6kgs!) but will readily bark to alert you to someone at the door! I love to be snuggled - belly rubs are the best! I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3.

If she is found to be intact (i.e. goes on heat), spay after her heat cycle ends. 5. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 6.

Cat,12.0,Male,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Large,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"[ Update on Oct ] ""October"" is still available for adoption. He needs a loving home without any adult male cats. He is an alpha cat and dominates other adult male cats. However he adores litters and cares for them lovingly, playing the role of daddy and mummy cat simultaneously. He brought up 3 siblings when I rescued them age 1 month old. Now they are 5 months old and ready for adoption. ""October"" nurse them and thanks to ""October"" these 3 siblings survive without a mummy. ********************************************* I picked up October 09 (as u can see thats the time I picked him)at a market place at Sri Gombak. This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around. Well likes to play with kittens, like chasing them round the house or wrestle with them.",e18cc7a60-6.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False

She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home. Details on your past experience with dogs will be much appreciated. Thank you!",962c84aa9-5.jpg,Irish_Wolfhound,True

That is why I need a new home with sane owners who will give me a pretty name… like I deserve! I was found wandering around a bustling urban area. All by myself. My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story… no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don’t mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress. That woman needs to get tested! I am old, tired and gray. All I want is a healthy arm to be my stay. I pray that someone will adopt me just to love me and protect me. I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world. If you have room in your home and in your heart, would you let me in? Would you spare me a chance to live happily with what is left of my days? I hope the angels whisper in your ear tonight, so you will find your way to me. I’ll be waiting…",f9e4762d2-9.jpg,Cocker_Spaniel,True

Cat,2.0,Male,Black,Gray,White,Small,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Minor Injury,0.0,"He is called Jellybean because he has always been small in size but strong in character and very, very sweet. He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g. On 20 Jan , he weighs g. On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life!

I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

I have been having her since she was 2 months old, and I grew her up in the condominium. She doesnt bark all day, and doesnt simply bark. She only barks when people and cats are around. She is a perfect dog everywhere. She sits still in cars, and doesnt jump around. She is a good passenger too. I love her very very much. Its very very sad to leave her for adoption, but I have no choice. I have to move to a house where no dogs are allowed. All places I asked do not allow dogs. I have no idea how. I really wish someone with a good heart for dogs can take her in. She is up for adoption from today onwards. January is the dateline and I have not found any friends who wants to take in another dog, as they are either occupied with dogs at their home , or they are afraid of dogs.

Our neighbours and friends chipped in for his treatment, and after a few months in the vet he's now up and about, and staying with us for the time being, until we find him a loving home. My housemates and I love him a lot, but unfortunately we won't be able to keep him as the three of us are not always home, and we aren't sure how long we'll be staying in this house. Chance is still young, the vet said at most 1.5 years. He is full of energy, but reasonably well behaved. A common friend of ours who is a dog-owner showed my housemates and I how to care for him. We take him for walks and/or runs daily - which is great because we get to exercise too! He's great company - generally listens and follows us when we walk, and does not bark at other dogs in houses we pass by. He's tries to make friends with cats and other dogs we meet on walks, but he's not always very lucky. Chance is a wonderful dog. As long as his energy is channeled regularly into positive activity, he will be very well behaved. He has misbehaved before, he chewed up my housemate's slippers and my bicycle pedals - but that's only because we forgot to take him out that day and he was bored out of his wits staying home alone. We haven't taught him any tricks, but he knows that whenever he sits down / calms down, good things may happen (i.e. go for walks, runs, gets more petting etc) - we try our best to encourage good behavior with treats or toys (tennis ball, stick, chewed up slipper etc), and we try our best to curb bad behavior either by ignoring it or staying away, or a pat on the bum with rolled up newspaper.

He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping!

Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Pinky started eating Hill's prescription diet A/D yesterday (/09)through a syringe. He used the litter box for the first time by himself on /09.

Cat,6.0,Male,Golden,White,Unknown,Small,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,100.0,"Mr Stripey (his temporary foster name) was rescued as part of a 3-kitten all-male litter together with their mother from a backlane opposite my home in early October . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well-socialised after almost 2 months of fostering them, the kittens are now ready to be rehomed. - They are applied with Revolution monthly to protect against fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms (dewormed). - Mr Stripey's weight has bloomed from 1.7kg on 11 October to 2.3kg as at 15 November . - They are fed with Evo premium dry kitten kibbles. - I'm feeding them with vet-approved Vetri-DMG liquid supplement to boost their growing development. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Catit premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - I regularly clean their eyes and noses with saline solution and their ears with Ilium Oticlean. I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",a0124e47a-2.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,True

No first time adopters without experience. Friendly first Time adopters with experience are welcome. 2. Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.",bca4defa4-8.jpg,Domestic_Medium_Hair,True

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- Her story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. G3 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",8910e2c01-8.jpg,Terrier,False

I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation.

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship.

Dog,4.0,Male,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,No,Yes,Yes,No,Minor Injury,0.0,"Hi there, my name is Little Dragon. I’m a 4-month old boy. My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, that’s how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when I’ll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, I’m able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but I’ll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie). Thank you. 大家好，我的名字叫小龙。我是一只4个多月大的宅男。 妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹。 妈妈生下了我们之后，得了子宫颈癌。还好，经过4次的化疗之后， 总算挨过了这一关。 好了，说一说我的小故事吧！ 我出世没多久，在一次意外中，我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击，破了3个洞。 从此，当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时，我竟然连爬起来都有问题。 还有，我看东西时也是模模糊糊的。我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了。 我不知道我几时会好起来，或许永远都会是这样。 幸好，吃了两个月的药以后，我总算可以站起来走路。然而，有时还是会跌跌撞撞的。 由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我，所以我想透过面子书， 寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人。 只是，以我这样的生世，或许很难吧。。。。。 有意领养我的好心人，请联络我的暂养主人(Annie)。 我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻，乖乖的等待我的新主人。请别让我等太久哦。。。 谢谢大家。",0c5d5968b-8.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

Please visit and give the many puppies looking for a home a chance, read here for more details: Nera was found wandering at a cross junction late at night in Ara Damansara oblivious to the cars whizzing past dangerously. Now vaccinated and ready to go to a good home. Very playful and alert, will make a good guard dog as she already barks at strangers that walk past my house and has no fear of my grumpy older dog haha. Knows how to do her business on grass. Adopter must spay her when older and make sure the outside compound of the house is escape-proof. Due to her active and plucky nature she is more suited for outdoor living, but if you're experienced with housebreaking puppies keeping her indoors shouldn't be a problem. /09: For those curious about estimated size and age, the vet estimates Nera is between 2-3 months old. She currently measures approx 12"" tall at the withers and about 12"" long from shoulder to rump. Going by her current size she'll grow into at least a medium size dog.

Cat,29.0,Male,Black,Brown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,90.0,"Opus (his temporary foster name) was found in my backlane and believed to be abandoned because he was new to the neighbourhood, bullied by established community cats and did not know how to look for food. Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.",29a08292f-8.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,True

Dog,24.0,Male,Golden,Cream,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,80.0,"Ara needs a forever home! Believe me, he's a really sweet guy! Here's his story: Ara was found along Jalan Cempaka in Kg Sg Kayu Ara on 18th April, , with a wire cable wrapped tightly around his left hind leg. It had cut almost to the bone and rendered the leg useless. He was rescued and taken to a vet. Thankfully, as Ara was rescued early enough, there was no infection and the leg was saved. It is now almost healed and there does not appear to be any long-term damage to it. In fact, Ara is now able to put his weight on the leg and run, jump (he is an amazing jumper!), and play just like any other dog. Ara was at a fosterer’s since 21st April, , but his resources are stretched as he has his own dog. Therefore, he has since been sent to PAWS Animal Welfare Society on 3rd June . Between the vet and the fosterer, Ara’s mild case of tick fever was also addressed. We urge any kind soul to adopt Ara and bring him home with you. He's a well-mannered and friendly dog with a penchant for playing with balls and shuttlecocks. He is easy to bathe and walk and is good with children, including young ones. From his behaviour and mannerisms, Ara was likely someone else’s pet before, but he is also very street smart now, no doubt due to his time as a stray. Please give Ara a home if you can. We really hope he doesn’t have to go back to being a stray. Thank you for your consideration, and please share! You may visit him at PAWS.

He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it.

She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me).

Dog,24.0,Female,Gray,White,Unknown,Large,No,Unknown,Unknown,Yes,Minor Injury,300.0,"Breed: Husky Age: 2 Weight: 15.6kg She was having very bad skin condition when we found her. When we brought her to the vet, she was diagnosed with having demodex due to her low immunity. After about 9 weeks of treatment, her furs grew and she has became more active. She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back. We spoke to the vet about it and vet says that it's most probably her immunity that is causing the growth of the demodex. She has been with the fosterer for 3 months but the fosterer has to move out from her current place and shift to another place where the new landlord doesn't allow any pets. Currently she is in the clinic under the care of vet but the boarding fee is an issue to us. We are looking for experienced adopter (preferably owned a Husky before) where: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging 2. Must be able to provide medical needs, yearly vaccination etc 3. Allow visits & follow ups (send me pictures & videos of Brandy during initial stage of adoption) 4. Adoption is only open for family residing in Klang Valley (Malaysian only) 5. Must be able to provide plenty of companionship (exercise & daily walk) 6. Must be living in landed house 7. Preferably having one or more friendly playful dogs at home 8. In the event that you're not able to take care of Brandy anymore, she must be returned to me.

But can only stay there til the end o this week!! :( (IF THIS IS YOUR DOG CONTACT ME ASAP) My friend found this poor doggy outside her mother-in-law'a house area. He was just lying there in the muddy ground, and was quite weak to stand up, but was mild mannered. My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there. They did not know who is the owner but he sure was either abandoned or somehow dragged himself? It seems unlikely that he is just lost when his two hind legs are too weak to stand for more than 6 seconds. She called me for help as I had some experience. While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring ""Bobby"" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening. Her husband and the lady herself have helped bringing the dog to the vet, as well as financially giving as much as they can. BUT THEY CANT FOSTER/ADOPT THE DOG because they were not used to dogs as well them being muslims. >> Please do contact me via whatsapp if you can foster the dog. He is really sweet, really!! A bit of a lazy whiny bum, but he is gentle. But does not do well with cats, mind you. Overall, he is a good dog. And overall health is alright, just the hind legs are swollen due to arthritis or old age, which needs surgery or physio. But our concern is to find a fostering home first. Financially, we can try to raise fund.",25765058c-4.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

I am very handsome with a very long tail, I am charming, very affectionate and I love children. A funny thing happened one day ...... I went to my home but no-one was there!!! I saw a big truck and people putting things into it ... even my favourite couch!!!! I did not know what was happening. Everyday I went home and no-one was there, and boy was I getting hungry. I have been fed by my people since I was a baby kitten, I haven't learnt to find food for my self and all the neighbourhood toms kept picking on me, I'm a lover not a fighter!! Then I started getting itchy, very itchy, think I had a skin disease and it was getting very sore, and had lost so much weight. Thankfully one of my friends, Chica, took me to her home and her Mum gave me some food, oh it was so good! She took me to the vet too! I had a jab and the sore itchiness is getting better. Chica's Mum starting calling me Elroy, it's a good name for me. I understand it is hard for Chica's Mum to keep me and she is trying to find a new home for me, and I am grateful. The other day Chica's Mum took me back to the vet and I had a long sleep, when I woke up I was a bit tender in my private area, I think the vet took my things off!!

Dog,13.0,Female,White,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"A Terrier mix who loves to walk, hyperactive, loves to play, obedient. The Journey: Sep : Adopted from old aunty at 1 month old. Jan : Gave away to a family in Selangor. Sep : News from new foster family says need to let her go due to their daughter medical reason. Oct : 1. Deliver to a nice lady staying alone with cat. She finds Fifi too hyperactive for her lifestyle as she prefers quite dog. So within 1 week, opt to return back fifi. She took a good care of Fifi. 2. After 5 days, 3 queries, so selected 1 family. Delivered to her. Within 1 night, she opt to returned as according to her, Fifi cant get along with her husband and she is very defensive over herself when her other mongrel (kept outdoor) barks at her. 3. Took her next night, and delivered straight to another owner. She is a dog lover. First night was ok. 2nd day, she sms said to return back. Reason being, Fifi is blending in well with entire family BUT barks at stranger. Her parents don'.t like Fifi to barks at stranger. But opt to try. 3rd day, she sms again saying she need to attend interview in Melaka and going to stay there with aunts and cant bring Fifi along. 4. So I took back and now Fifi is at home with me. ************************************************* After a tiring transfer here and there.

Nicole Suresh and Elton Joshua spotted him a couple of days ago and assumed that he belonged to someone in the area who had let him out, and so didn't think much of it. But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up.

Dog,5.0,Female,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,100.0,"Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",86547ad6d-5.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False
Dog,60.0,Male,Black,White,Unknown,Small,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,".: I as the owner decided not to give up on Zorro, so he has been with me all these while..however, im in need of favor and am looking for a temporary fosterer ...tops 3 months or less..preferably someone with landed property and very gentle with Zorro as he is quite a scaredy cat..he is afraid of strangers and large dogs but he is very sweet once he knows you. preferably someone staying nearby seputeh, brickfields, midvalley , bangsar area as i would be dropping by to pick him up for grooming or replenish his food. Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer. If there is anyone interested let me know and of course i would need to scan through the fosterer as Zorro means a lot to me. If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.",85fd5df90-1.jpg,Spitz,False

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

Dog,7.0,Female,Black,Brown,White,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,500.0,"For more pics go here: 9th April edit: I have revised the adoption fee to RM to include the fee I paid her breeder. The reason I am now making reimbursement of the breeder's fee compulsory is to help out Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) - they are currently in dire financial straits (read this for details and please help if you can: ). Previously if Donut's adopter voluntarily reimbursed the breeder's fee I had planned to donate the RM to MDDB anyway, since they really need funding I reckon a sincere adopter won't mind the expense as it's going to a good cause. 6th April edit: The family who intended to adopt Donut backed out due to personal reasons (hectic things going on in their lives, nothing to do with Donut herself). So this bundle of beagle-y joy is up for adoption again! :) 5th March edit: I have had people contact me asking if she's old enough to mate. Apparently some people can't read - DONUT HAS BEEN SPAYED. Meaning she can't get pregnant. If you want to adopt her with the intention of breeding her, don't bother contacting me. Donut is an affectionate beagle that loves human and canine company. Trained to do toileting on grass and knows a few tricks - sit, paw, high five, up, down, stand, responds to her name and stays on command in the presence of food. Well socialised and impervious even to thunderstorms (she will calmly snooze under whichever car's in the porch whereas my adult dog will be running around in a panic)! She has some good and bad traits typical of beagles. The good: She's a pack animal as beagles are bred to be and therefore gets along well with other dogs (plays happily with my lab pup and even my temperamental adult mutt). Very friendly even with new people - strangers are constantly delighted when they approach her. The bad: She loves digging holes in the garden (a common problem with beagles). So if you love gardening and your lawn must look immaculate she is not the dog for you. She will also chew stuff you leave lying around which is typical behaviour for all teething puppies. 9th April edit: This isn't necessarily a good/bad thing as it's a natural inclination due to her breed (beagles were originally bred to hunt), but forgot to mention, Donut has a high prey drive when it comes to small animals and cannot be trusted unsupervised with them. She has killed squirrels and birds that wandered into my garden so if you have small animals as pets in your home (rabbits/hamsters/sugar gliders etc.) she would not be a good fit. She's curious and friendly with adult cats when supervised but I would not advise keeping her if you have kittens as I'm not sure if she might mistake them for prey to hunt due to their small size. For those who might wonder why this lovely dog is up for adoption: She is the product of an irresponsible breeder - I'd rather not go into details because remembering how she came into being in my care makes me mad =/ Initially I was hoping to keep her but being a person who believes one should spend a lot of quality time with his/her dog, I've reluctantly come to the conclusion that with 2 dogs of my own I just cannot give Donut the attention she deserves. I spend at least 2 hours a day with my dogs - my opinion is that if you only have time to feed your dog and give it a quick pat as you leave for work/return, then you do not have enough time for a dog. I hope she will find a loving home where love can be lavished on her instead of her present situation where she is receiving limited attention. Adoption fee is for covering her vaccination (she has had the full set of shots) and spaying costs. On top of those expenses I had to pay off the breeder to have Donut released to me (otherwise the breeder would have dumped her at SPCA or pawned her off to the first willing buyer who may have turned out to be a backyard breeder). If you are a serious adopter and able to reimburse me for the breeder's fee (RM) this would be greatly appreciated - I will donate the reimbursed amount to a dog rescue organisation. [PLEASE NOTE the 9th April edit on top of this listing - the breeder's fee is now compulsory.) I am going to be blunt and state upfront that I can afford to be very selective about the home she goes to and will be. After all, pedigreed dogs are more popular (I wish more people would love mixed breeds just as much, but this is the unfortunate reality) and I am in no hurry rehome her. My priority is finding Donut a home where she will receive more love and attention than I can give her at the moment. Bearing the above in mind, these are my conditions for adoption: 1. You MUST have time for her. Donut thrives on attention - when I first fostered her she had separation anxiety and would whine and howl if there were no humans or dogs to keep her company (with training she is now a confident dog). As such I strongly prefer a home where there is a friendly dog for companionship. If Donut will be the only dog in the household, I would prefer if the household has someone able to give her constant attention (i.e. retiree/homemaker/work-at-home/kids). 2. No tying or caging up (unless you find a constantly howling beagle particularly enjoyable....). 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover medical costs and breeder's fee. 4. Patience with destructive behaviour that is inevitable with all puppies. 5. Maintain her on a premium kibble (she is currently on Orijen)/raw food diet. 6. Allow me to visit in the beginning to check on her wellbeing (as such I am looking for adopters in the KL/Selangor area so that this is possible). 7. Lavish her with love, love and more love! :) I would appreciate it if you could email a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, which area you live in, your household situation (what type of home you live in, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and why you would like to adopt Donut. I will get back to you with my contact number for further discussion.",f663a91e8-1.jpg,Beagle,False

Big built like a Rottweiler, but a very gentle & lovable dog. Doesnt bark at all, but will whine & may howl a bit in excitement when he sees you. Gets along fine with other dogs & even cats. One of the few dogs i know that doesnt bark or chase cats when he sees one in close proximity. Appears to be in good health condition & has no signs of illness or injuries. Please consider adopting him & giving him a chance for a better life. He'd really make a good pet with his calm personality. Update as at 16 Jan : Dog is still around. He is so scared & just hides under the cars all the time. Refused food for many days & just started eating since yesterday. Definitely had an owner before. If you think you know his owner, please let them know that their dog misses home terribly. 5 Jan : Spotted this dog roaming around Bandar Utama (BU 11). Not sure if it is a stray that made its way here or a lost dog. Appears old but generally looks well taken care of, although very timid. Has a very unique stumpy tail.

It all depends on how you approach him. He generally tends to bark at anyone that passes by the house (or if there's a cat or a noisy vehicle) but it's only because he's protective of the masters of the house. He's a well-groomed and active dog that needs a lot of exercise in the morning before you leave the house. If not, he has a nasty habit of chewing anything in sight. If you do intend to adopt him, I think it would be best to channel has energies by enrolling him in agility courses or even guard/watch dog training. He likes to play fetch with a ball and I like setting him loose leash in a safe open space to play and run around with him. He knows the basic commands but is not always obedient and tends to get distracted. Though when it comes to meal times, he will always obey!

That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most.

Cat,12.0,Female,Black,Gray,White,Medium,Yes,No,No,No,Healthy,0.0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",b6fbfa344-10.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,True

Dog,12.0,Male,Brown,Cream,White,Small,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"To the kind person taking the time to read this, My name is Oreo and I'm just over one year old, male, pure Shih Tzu. I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",8f15fc3d8-8.jpg,Shih_Tzu,True

Much appreciated. ------------------------------------ His story : Was rushing to an appointment and saw this lil one hiding under a red car at an area that we are familiar with. Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",7adf54516-7.jpg,German_Shepherd_Dog,False

Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life!

It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT.

He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the cat and forgo the need for house visits to check on him. 3) The kitten must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 6 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM59 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will just cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. 8) Adopt him at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Murphy, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate?

It was so persistent and traumatizing even for us to hear. We zoned in on where this sound was coming from. It was directly at the back of our home, over a high wall near a neighbouring clubhouse’s tennis courts. We got into the car, ready with food, carrier, gloves and a cloth. Once we got into the grounds, with the help of the security guard on duty, we found in a drain that led to nowhere this teeny tiny puppy, crying pitifully with its last breaths. We caught a hold of her (no resistance was given) and brought her home. After a reviving drink of warm goat’s milk, little Roxanne was all wagging tail, snuggling her way into our laps and licking our hands in gratitude and instant love. She was de-fleadand was given a warm bed, and all she did for two days was eat, wag her tail, snuggle up and sleep. We were unsure if she would make it.

It would be good if you can keep her in the house or in the house compound instead of in the cage because she's not the kind of cat you keep inside a cage, she'd get depressed and become rebellious.

Cat,8.0,Male,Black,White,Unknown,Medium,Unknown,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"Hello.. feline agent Maxwell here! ♥ My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from home a few weeks ago and got lost. I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ♥ I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ♥ Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ♥ Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ♥ I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ♥ I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ♥ I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ◘ Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. ◘ Adoption fees will apply (to cover is neutering & vaccination cost). Please inquire. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take this lad home, please drop me an email or text at my number.

I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

Cat,4.0,Female,Black,White,Unknown,Medium,No,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"If your cat is lonely, here is the perfect solution: a cat who loves other cats. BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months.

She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",74d7a26bc-4.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False
Cat,7.0,Female,Brown,White,Unknown,Small,No,Unknown,Unknown,No,Healthy,0.0,"::How I found the cat:: I've seen this cat for few days and it actually belongs to my neighbour. Recently, it seems like they always forgot to let her entered their home. On 16 Sept, I found her again outside of her owners home with a bag of frieskies on the floor. It seems like the owner has move out from the place (I saw all the unwanted stuff in front of the place). The cat seems to be domesticated and can't live on its own. I took her into my place but I can't afford to adopt the cat for a long time. I'm still a student and always at the library doing research or go to class. Plus, i also will have financial issue if I adopt her (Even now I only eat a meal per day) I didn't named her yet since I don't want to get too attach. She is a friendly and well mannered cat. She likes to be among people, responds when people talk to her and know how to use the litter box. There are a few drawbacks: She is pregnant(I'm not sure how many months), she have fleas, she have earmites, I'm not sure if she is vaccinated or not, and maybe she have worms. I hope a kind and sincere person will adopt her. She is a lovable cat and I hope the next owner will treat her right.",e73146163-2.jpg,Ragdoll,True

A friend had called to say that a puppy had just suddenly turned up in her housing area all alone. The neighbours threatened to call DBKL eventhough she was such a wee pup. So Nicole Suresh﻿ and I headed over there as soon as we could and picked her up. We gave her a quick bath as she had quite a few ticks and thankfully we managed to get a foster carer for her who will be looking after her until she is ready for adoption. We have decided to call her Dakota as she is so friendly, and the name Dakota literally means friend. She's also very good with other dogs and got along with the foster carer's dogs immediately. We have just dewormed her and she's going for a check up tomorrow. She will be vaccinated after a week or two as we need to make sure that she hasn't got any underlying health problems.

She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2) Love her unconditionally .3) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back.

Cat,5.0,Female,Cream,Gray,White,Medium,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,150.0,"Chloe is a little white/cream/gray kitten found alone across a big main road at night, attracting the dogs of the entire neighbourhood who were all barking at her, especially our own rescue dog. When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type.

Dog,6.0,Female,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"I love Guana alot. Guana Description: 1) She is very active, she likes to run alot. So everyday I take her to a padang to run. Sometimes she might be hyperactive, jumping on you licking u nonstop etc. 2) She is very attach to People/ Owners. at the same time very playful with other dogs, can mingle well. 3) She will guard you door at night, barks at strangers walking past or walking close. In the morning sometimes she barks at passerby, but most of the day-time she sleeps. 4) Not yet very Obediant but very very trainable (with doggy Treats and Cane, depending on situation). She is trained not to bite shoes already (but sometimes she still flings it around for fun, but wont chew on it). 5) Can understand Simple words like: ""Guana~"", ""Sit/ Sitdown"", ""Hand/ Shakehand"", ""Come"", ""NO!"", ""Da Da Le!!""(Means Beat Beat in Chinese), 6) Will chase cats (Chase Only). Wont bite cats, will only surround/ trap it at a corner and bark at it non stop. Will stop kaciao-ing the cat if you yell ""Guana NOo!!"". The Reason she hate cats is once she got Clawed by a stray cat, at first she wants to make friends with it wagging her tail jumping around her, then CLAWW!!!. Now she hate them species.  The Reasons I am giving her up for adoption. 1) WORK- My working life has increase in activitivities, I have to go outstation or out of country alot more now (for days, weeks, coming project need to leave msia for a month :[ ). No more 9-5 job. Hiah. things Change so suddent. 2) Family- Suddently Parents decided to come back from overseas, and plan to stay in Msia for a long time. So means Garage park one more car= less space for guana to run. And they dont like Dogs, If I am not around they wont walk my dog. Most they did so far is fed her (very reluctantly) when I am not around. They are ok with her(wont hurt or scold her), but I know in their mind they see her as a burden. * What She needs now is Friends. Sometimes I can feel her loneliness. I feel sad. When she has a friend she can play many many hours with it and wont get tired. * Training her with tid bids and snacks are more effective than cane. Cane should only be use as a threatning gesture only. Only use it when she did something very wrong on purpose. * Maybe I am spoiling her too much. Hmmmm. * You can Change name if you like, as she is still young. some commands she still havent fully understand. Sometimes she dosent respond to her own name. * Feel free to take her feeding n drinking bowl, leash, collar and her remaining dog food. Let me know. If u want or dont want the things. * Hopefull I can find a genuine adopter before I leave on a short(9days) outstation trip on the 25th feb. But has to be adopted before 16th march before my taiwan (3weeks)business trip.  I Hope someone will understand my situation as there are so many unprecidented sudden changes in my life lately. I am Sorry to all that is reading this, because I could not continue taking care of her as my work will get even busier in the weeks to come. Hope a Genuine good adopter will take Guana in to their family (prefer people with dog(s) already, I dont want her to be lonely).",de97498e6-9.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

He does not like being left alone, and is ONLY kept indoors. He is extremely afraid of loud noises especially when it is raining or when there are fireworks. Samba is also potty trained, and needs to go for his walks as frequent as possible.

We have to say that Jacker is a real smart boy - an abandoned Jack Russell who ran into our home compound one morning and tapped at our glass door to seek help! We took him in and found that he was dirty, having bad skin condition and emaciated. It was believed that he had been loitering on street for a long period. After sent him to vet clinic we found that he actually had microchip which showed the details of his 1st owner.

The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good! Jacker is a completely different boy now after staying with us for few months, he's happy, friendly with every dogs, loves to have pat on head, loves to run and walk around when he's happy, not aggressive to strangers anymore and the skin condition is fully recovered.

Dog,12.0,Male,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Unknown,Healthy,0.0,"Update 27 Oct : on Saturday 25 Oct , Boy went to Central Park, Desa Park City and he was having a lot of fun running and walking around the lake for about 2 hours. He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him.

Cat,4.0,Female,Black,Brown,White,Medium,Yes,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Tabatha was rescued along with 7 other kittens after someone rounded them up and threw them away in a box by the roadside. They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

My brother and I found this adventurous little boycat yesterday stuck in the engine of a motorbike at the Section 17 night hawker centre.

Nishi can eat solid wet kitten food already, and has a clean bill of health from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital; he just got dewormed today. Sadly I can't keep him because my parents won't let me, but PAWS and ASPCA and other sanctuaries I've tried appear to be full up. I'd rather not put him back on the street, though, so if you would like to or you know anyone who'd like to take him into your home, please send me a message! Thanks.

But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family.

Dog,18.0,Female,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Healthy,0.0,"Hey everyone! Klover was rescued by my mom and I from a street nearby my place. We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal. All Klover needs is a good home :)",05e3bc1ae-1.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

A sprinter, loves toys and exploring new things. He enjoys being carried around the house to see things or even outside, however of course he chooses when this happens (not a cuddle-cat while he's playing around). When he's tired or sleeping though - he will seek our arms and is the sweetest thing! He's a nipper and tester of everything so energetic homes or true cat-people will be his best match. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Markus must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets.

Cat,72.0,Male,Black,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"When I search through the cats on petfinder for adoption, my heart sank as most cats are cuter, younger and prettier than Ninja. Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

Cat,36.0,Male,Brown,Cream,White,Medium,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,No,Healthy,0.0,"How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime.",6c399cb06-2.jpg,Shih_Tzu,True

He was clearly lost, and was frightened and confused. After spending ages trying to calm him down, we managed to get him home. Unfortunately he did not get along with one of our foster dogs at all. So we had to board him at our vet while we tried to locate his family. We have had no luck so far as no one has come forward to claim him although his picture has been shared alot and we have also put up posters in the area where we found him and in the surrounding tamans. He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place. We have discovered that he's okay with female dogs and puppies :) but dislikes adult male dogs. Buster is a really sweet dog and loves to sit and cuddle in your lap. He loves car rides too and would sit in your lap and look out the window quite happily. Buster needs to be in a home environment with someone who will give him lots of cuddles and love.

Cat,4.0,Male,White,Unknown,Unknown,Large,No,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Yota was found by my mom as this little kitten was stuck in her car (specifically, the engine compartment). We found out that he was there by his extremely vocal expressions. We called out to him and he crawled out onto my hand like a child reaching out to feel a mother's touch for the first time. He was named after the car which was a Toyota; Thus Yota. When we found him, he was so skinny and was crawling from parasites. Fast forward to a month later, he is an active kitten with a doggy best friend/big sister. He is very vocal, very active, and definitely very brave. At times, Pipi has to find ways to avoid him as he would treat her as his scratching post. He is smart and also has a mind of his own. Yota can be a wonderful companion to a housewife or to children but will not do well with a working household. I am letting him go as I am part of that working household and he is locked in a cage almost the entire day to prevent him from running out and being stuck in another car or worse, run over. This kitten is super cute and is a super sweet heart. If you adopt him into your family, I only have 2 conditions: 1) to love, take care, and provide him the freedom to be the active lil kitty he is; 2) to have him spayed by his 5th month of age. I wish to visit him again when he is in his 5th month to ensure that that is done. Thanks for reading to this point.

Cat,14.0,Female,Black,Brown,Yellow,Medium,No,No,Yes,Yes,Healthy,200.0,"My people kept many of us. We were all semi long haired. I loved them because they were kind and fed us well. The small ones would sometimes make us toys from rolled up news paper and bits of string. They also let us out of the cage we lived in and I enjoyed running and chasing, climbing and rolling around on the floor. One day I had babies. My people looked at me a lot and whispered furtively. I did not understand what they were saying but I was too busy caring for my babies. One morning, almost a week after having my babies, we were all packed into a box. After some strange jostling and swaying, the box plummeted to the ground and there was silence. I began to feel afraid and began to wonder what to do while nursing my babies. When the boxed was next opened, I heard a girl’s voice. “Aiyo! Not again. Mummy cat and five kittens.” She picked us up and check us over. I was worried when she inspected the kittens but she seemed gentle if unimpressed. I was insulted as my kittens were the loveliest in the world, in my opinion that is. “Pity they are all short haired” said the girl. “The mummy has semi long hair, quite pretty.” I was placed in a room with glass walls. This I found most disconcerting as I was accustomed to bars and steel. I could see many other cats. They were curious and came very close. This made me very worried; would they try to harm my babies? Would they steal the food I needed to keep making milk for my babies? I missed my people. I missed the children who would play with me. I missed my cat friends too. A few days later, the girl, Olivia she was called, gingerly showed me a few more babies. My heart swelled. they were dirty and weak. Two black boys and a little calico girl. Where was their mummy, I wondered? I immediately cleaned them with my tongue and tried to feed them. With 8 kittens to take care of, I was too tired to worry or miss my old home. In fact, I was so tired, I barely had the energy to eat. “She is falling ill.” “Crap, what about the kittens?” “Not yet. But they will.” I heard them talking about us and making arrangements to take us to the vet. I hated being separated from my babies and foster babies. We were such a big group we had to be placed into two separate carriers. The journey in the car reminded me of my last car trip. Alicia drove us and she sent Reiki. I knew we were going to get help so I reserved my energy. “Her name is Tallulah, a Gealic name meaning ‘fruitful woman’ because she takes care of so many ” I heard Alicia say to the nurse. Over the next ten days, we were pilled, dropped and force fed. Olivia and Weng fought hard to help us regain our health. Two of my foster babies died but gradually we got better. “Shit! Two more in a box” said Olivia. “Tallulah Mama is too weak. We must hand raise” decided Alicia. Dr Bel agreed. But I was getting better and they crying kittens hurt my heart. When Olivia had them at the shop, I did my best to show her I wanted to help. I would pace my room and speak to her. She began to let the kittens spend the days with me but she took them home at night. I missed them and worried if they would be warm enough and if they would get enough milk. In the mean time, my babies recovered and began to play. A few days ago, Dr Bel decided I was completely better so Olivia let the two new babies live with me. I am taking care of them but they are very naughty. They climb and jump like monkeys and my own babies think they are ill mannered because they did not have a good mummy like they did. I will keep trying to instill good manners and proper feline dignity in my two new babies though I think it will be a tough journey. “AIKS!” I heard Olivia shout again today. I know something has happened. She usually sleeps, smiles and is slow and gentle. Now she is groaning and calling Alicia. She is very animated and distressed. I look out of my room and can see a box. I can hear more babies crying. I look at my extended brood of 8 and sigh. Can I do more? The answer is, “I must try.”",319e533b6-1.jpg,Domestic_Medium_Hair,False

Dog,0.0,Female,Black,Brown,Unknown,Small,Yes,No,No,No,Healthy,0.0,"On Wednesday I was visiting PAWS in Ara Damansara to look for a new kitten for my family, when a gentleman arrived with very young pup he found on the side of the road lost from its mother. I offered to take it in to PAWS. Not knowing PAWS was closed on Wednesdays we then took the pup to the VET who confirmed she is a girl, healthy looking and between 7 to 10 days. We have been looking after her since Wednesday afternoon. She has been feeding very well and her urine and motion looks very healthy. She is very happy with her little tail wags and wriggling around the box. However, we live in a condo and due to personal/business life we are unable to look after or raise a dog. However, we do not want her to be put down or sent to shelter where she will most likely not survive. The poor little girl needs someone to hand raise her and give her the love and care she needs. If the right home for her needs financial support for her injections/vet/spade I am happy to help. **Update - it's been 5 days since I posted this and she is a super happy dog... lots of tail wags, she is very healthy...

I was hoping to keep her, but my 19 year old cat is too stressed out with a kitten in the house. She is black and white with a smudge of white on one side of her nose and a smudge of black under her chin. She has 3 full white socks and one foot with white toes. She has the tiniest little hook at the end of her long tail. She is very healthy and is eating wet and dry food, and is litter box trained. She was one of the smallest kittens in a litter of 6 that were abandoned near my home last month. I just want to let you know that she has a slightly deformed sternum that is already starting to settle down as she is growing. For this reason, she needs more gentle care when lifting and she may incur some vet bills later to find out how this affects her diaphragm and organs.....if at all. I am willing to assist with vet bills. If you come to meet Smudges, you will see that it does NOT affect her racing around, pouncing, climbing or playing one little bit!

However, it's been almost half a year that she's staying with us now but have not been able to get along well with the the kitties at home (she's quite active and playful but they are not, which makes the environment quite stressful sometimes for all of them).

My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines.

Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either.

He can do a variety of tricks and is smart; seems to be alright by himself as well, even after being left alone. Loves people; but not so much other dogs. Very calm and loving; craves affection.

When I approached him, I realised he could not stand as his right leg was injured. Managed to transport him to the Vet. X ray showed that he suffers from pelvic bone and tail bone fracture. The pelvic bone fracture, according to the vet, will heal by itseslf but the tail may have to be amputated. There WAS no anal tone, hence he couldn't control his bowel movement. Currently he is still in the animal hospital and besides conventional treatment, he is also undergoing acupuncture treatment. I am so happy to hear from the vet few days ago that the anal tone is coming back. So this mean the possibility of him regaining control of his bowel movement is very high. He is a very clean conscious dog. Keeps on licking himself and can paw whenever you extend your hand! He will give the other paw when u ask for ""Another Paw""! The potential owner has to be very committed as it may be quite messy if the treatment is not successful.

Cat,0.0,Female,Black,Cream,White,Small,Yes,No,No,No,Healthy,0.0,"Hey everyone! So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",66ad04874-4.jpg,American_Shorthair,False

Dog,24.0,Male,Black,Brown,Golden,Medium,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"Rex was an abandoned and we believe abused dog that was rescued by a client from an area close to her workplace. The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too. She is very obedient coz I think she had an owner before. She is house trained. I kept her in my living room all this time to separate her from my existing dogs.

Cat,2.0,Male,Black,White,Unknown,Small,Yes,No,No,No,Healthy,0.0,"It was late at night when I was about to leave from work when I heard loud meowings near my car. I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily.

We really do hope that her family claims her soon. She is very depressed. /13 Found this girl stuck inside a 5 foot deep drain while walking the kids this morning. She was looking very weak and exhausted. So told her to stay there, raced the kids back and got Nicole Lee Suresh to come with me to get her out. We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results.

Cat,2.0,Male,Golden,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,No,No,No,Healthy,200.0,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

He lurrve to eat...and he is adoringly ""big"" size ( I think he is 8 kilos)...so you can treat him like a baby and hug and cuddle him. He hates it when people whistle and if you do that, he will chase you around the house. His life is pretty balance, he likes to play and then sleep. If you like a companion, please adopt him and give him a good life. He is tough, rarely get sick (compared to kitten). Though I love him so much, my parents in law are against cats () and I have to let him go. Please contact me (will give you the cage n the cat food as well). I usually feed him twice a day in the morning before going to work and in the afternoon. He eats various cat foods, currently he is on Science Plan. He is also toilet trained. If you have other cats, he is usually friendly, but it depends on the chemistry like us humans.

Dog,8.0,Female,Golden,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"In February this year I was alerted to 7 abandoned puppies in my area. With the help of Malaysia Dogs Deserve Better I was able to find homes for 6 of them through their amazing adoption drives. Lily Lulu was the 'runt' of the litter - the small weak one that nobody wanted. I decided to raise her, rather than throwing her to the streets, however I'm not Malaysian, and due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm transferring to a country that's even less dog friendly, and I can't take her with me (Although I wish I could). She's house trained (does her 'business' outside) around 95%, she's fully vaccinated, dewormed, had Tic prevention medicine applied and has recently been neutered. She has a good temperement - sometimes a little nervous of loud noises, but very playful. As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food. If you'd consider giving Lily Lulu a home - please get in touch with me, and I'll happily bring her to meet you at your home anywhere in KL.",e911008b8-5.jpg,Mixed_Breed,True

Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training.

Cat,4.0,Female,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,100.0,"Shiro is a white lilac-pointed kitty who looks a bit like Taylor Swift. She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",281618ba5-1.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False

The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant.

Cat,4.0,Male,Yellow,Cream,White,Large,Unknown,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Introducing dashing little Ferauni! ♥ Male kitten, 4 months old (D.O.B: ). Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire.

They have to be adopted together as a pair because they are familiar with each other. The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

Dog,7.0,Female,White,Unknown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"I've had Angel for a year now, and know all Angel's good traits as below: 1) Once Angel trusts you, she will be a loving and loyal pet, who will greet you VERY excitedly when you come home (even if gone for 5 minutes!). Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",a906ff5f5-6.jpg,Labrador_Retriever,False

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed.

All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other.

Cat,3.0,Female,Black,Brown,Cream,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,100.0,">^.^< Kayama >^.^< If you are looking for a kitten full of love and play then this is the companion for you! We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work.

He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would!

A once healthy, boisterous dog is now disabled...according to the local residents, the dog was found with its paw cut off..I guess someone took him to the vet and got him fixed. They even have placed a bogus collar around his neck to make him look as if he belongs to someone..but he is still in danger, cause he is still out there straying....is there anyone willing to take in this sweet disabled dog? please contact me via telephone or email: usha. .

Dog,2.0,Female,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Update: Just to clear the doubts, Milo is a MIXED breed. I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",8f1bdc253-1.jpg,Mixed_Breed,True

I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

Cat,6.0,Male,Golden,White,Unknown,Medium,No,No,Yes,No,Healthy,0.0,"Are you ready for the cat-parrot? I found Wonky sitting on the step of a betting shop in SS2. He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self.",835fdb873-4.jpg,Ragamuffin,True

Dog,6.0,Female,Golden,Unknown,Unknown,Large,Unknown,No,No,No,Healthy,0.0,"We took in Marley from a sick gentleman who was unable to care for this puppy. Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her.

Cat,8.0,Female,Black,Gray,Unknown,Medium,Yes,No,No,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"Fifi ni merupakan salah seekor stray cat yang berada di kawasan perumahan saya. Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone. More photos of Fifie can be seen here:",24cc193f3-4.jpg,Domestic_Short_Hair,False

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and Molly (female 3yr, spayed).

As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

Cat,12.0,Male,Cream,White,Unknown,Large,No,No,Unknown,No,Healthy,0.0,"READ BEFORE DECIDING! Mio is an active, playful, and talkative male cat. He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)",74088eee1-4.jpg,Domestic_Medium_Hair,False

With sufficient exercise, she maintains a clean record for the past 3 weeks with us (she did not destroy anything at all). If you are willing to provide her with a good home, please contact me by leaving me a message. We prefer to re-home her to a new home within Klang Valley. Please describe: (1) Your experience with dogs (if any) (2) The environment you intend to provide her with (no cage, no unnecessary tie-up) (3) Please state if you agree to a 1-month trial in which we will visit once or twice to see if it is a good match Please note that those who do not describe the 3 key points will not get a reply from us.

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me.

Dog,12.0,Female,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Small,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"I found this dog back in May . She was abandoned by the roadside under the scorching hot sun (was around 2pm when i stumble upon her). She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive.

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him.

However, the 2 doggies are not welcoming the new additions and we are planning to send the mummy for spaying as soon as the 3 months period of weaning & whelping is over. The 3 months whelping period is soon going to be over. So, would like to inquire if anyone would like to adopt the puppies in 15 days time. Ps. We would prefer people who spay the puppies when they reach 3 months. Pss. Would prefer people who allow us visitation rights as we want to ensure the puppies are taken care off.",86fe4ed68-6.jpg,Mixed_Breed,True

My wife is giving birth to our first child in January and the reason we want to find a new home is that we do not want a dog around a small baby. Based on looks … for sure he is the number 1 in the world But overall he is more of a wild animal than a Lab / Beagle etc … and as a result we always need to treat him with respect / care. He needs a garden / space to run around in. We read a lot about the breed before we bought him. Everything that is on the internet about the breed (Shiba Inu) is % true. Their character, how they act, that they need to be on a leash … everything. We have had him fixed, so this calmed him down a lot. He is a healthy dog, been well looked after and in good health with a full passport / vaccinations etc. If you have anyone that would like to meet Wagyu, let us know and we can arrange any time. Above all else, we want to know that he has gone to a family that will love him as much as we have. It is a very hard decision to put Wagyu up for adoption.

Cat,5.0,Male,Golden,White,Unknown,Small,No,No,Yes,No,Healthy,150.0,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",8c1658988-26.jpg,Domestic_Medium_Hair,True

Dog,24.0,Male,Brown,White,Unknown,Medium,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Minor Injury,0.0,之前它常常跟随一位顾客来我们的咖啡店，它给我的印象就是很瘦，总是被主人骂，常常追跑在它主人的车后。突然消失了一段时间，还以为可能被抓狗队抓去了，因为我们这常常都有抓狗队，试过连续三个星期每天都来。去年 日傍晚它突然出现在我们店外，更加瘦了，脚还一拐一拐的，还有那无助的眼神，本以为或者给它一顿饱饭后好回家，它没吃饭，只是躲在一角，我想它应该是需要帮忙了，拖了我的狗笼往它方向走，辛好它的信任只是凶了我一下，没有把我咬。一整晚在笼子里面不吵不闹，就是很不舒服的样子。隔天幹紧把它送给兽医做检查，原来前脚是因为与其它的狗狗打架而化脓了，必须立刻开刀清洗，不然将会因脓毒而身亡。本来想着将它医好还给它主人，我清楚这位顾客并不会替我分担医药费，想着也算了，我只是可怜这毛孩。但是问题来了，从这位顾客朋友口中知道，原来这位主人从来不曾给它饭吃，难怪它那么瘦，更加生气的是工厂的孟加拉工人常常拿铁条往它身上抽，还试过被打得头破血流，难怪我常看见它四处游荡，其实是不敢回家。听后真的很生气，也不可能放它回地狱。兽医也很清楚我的情况与环境，不敢让它载回给我。如今它在兽医处已经超过2个月，住院费也不停的增加中，未知之数。那是因为我已经要照顾23位毛孩，大部分都是我这六年来挽救接近一百只毛孩而未能找到属于它们永远的家的孩子们，身为一位浪浪挽救者，我清楚知道我们所要面对的问题，并非每只都能幸运的找到属于它们的家。出不了的百年归老我们也只好都扛下了。这六年来我都自己照顾着它们，偶尔亲戚朋友的帮助让我减轻一些负担，如今我欠下一屁股债，欠下兽医 3 千多的医疗费，还未包括这毛孩的。幸好我的兽医从来都不曾催我还钱。她很清楚我的环境和能力。兽医只是常常告诉我不要再救了，或者你又扛上身啊！ 哈哈！我就是熬不过自己对毛孩的那分同情心，如果我们不帮它们将会更可怜了。可是一个人的力量实在太有限了。我每天除了要忙咖啡店，父母已经 六十多岁，还要照顾23位毛孩们，我已经没有能力收留照顾更多了。而且我家是咖啡店，还收养了那么多毛孩，被抓狗队吃了不少钱之外，也很担心被投诉，到时除了要被逼关门之外可能还会把我所有的毛孩都抓走，真的很怕。。。除了分享一下我的小故事，我是希望有心人可以帮帮忙让这可怜的毛孩有个休养的地方，或者让它找到一个属于它的家，疼它的主人。医疗费我会想办法，或者慢慢还，现在只想尽快让它出院，好好休养。如果你们可以帮个忙请联络我，感激不尽! 我在 KL 的，我的联络号码 - 谢谢！,21cc6a743-1.jpg,Mixed_Breed,False

This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is named Saffron or Saffy for short. I named this batch after spices haha. At first she seemed meek but she's actually really friendly and curious and likes to walk and run around. She takes after her mother, Mimi. Saffy might need to be introduced to food slowly as she doesn't eat as much as her sibling, so be prepared with some kitten milk just in case and then give her wet food and slowly some dried ones. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me.

Cat,36.0,Female,Black,Brown,Unknown,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0.0,"This lady cat has a sad story. She was in a family, being well taken care of. Then, her family left Malaysia… and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",39c654eaa-4.jpg,Tonkinese,False

Disebabkan ada banyak anjing di kawasan ni selepas jam 3 pagi, (itu pun jiran2 sekeliling yg bagitau sbb sy baru berpindah ke sini) sy amek keputusan untuk bawak ke rumah saya. His fur has been shaved because of hairball here and there, and also has been neutered. Bobby still in recovery process but he is healthy and eat a lot, his fur is getting softer than before because I give him a salmon oil and special food for his fur and his body getting heavier as well :) I would love to keep him as my pet, but I already have five cats in the house.

Dog,48.0,Female,Black,Brown,Unknown,Small,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Minor Injury,180.0,"20 April update: MinPin is on trial adoption MinPin was found on a busy road and is being put up for adoption since no one claimed her. She's now believed to be abandoned due to her cataract. Due to her early cataract which is probably genetically inherited, she can only see shadows from her right eye although she has good vision from her left eye. This would caused her to panic and start protecting herself by snapping if there's any sudden movement. However, when she knows you, get used to your voice, she will be as adorable as a kitten. In addition, due to her cataract problem and her not being well socialized, she will start barking whenever there's dogs or cats near her so she may not be suitable to multi-pet homes or has to be monitored when around other pets. As she was likely abandoned by her owner and probably had to fight for food while on the streets, she is still protective over her food while she's eating, so it's best not to disturb her when there's food in front of her. Behavior: - She's toilet trained, will only pee and poo outside the house. - She can walk off leash, she will follow the clapping sound when you want her to follow. - healthy and fit, loves to be with humans. - Her personality and attitude is more suitable for a family that do not have other pets but the adopting family has to be patient when dealing with MinPin and she will eventually listen and be an extreme cute girl when she gets to know you better. The adopter should be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the dog and forgo the need for physical visits to check on her. By the way, MinPin was featured in Star newspaper on 16 February under the Dog Talk column. Thank you, Ellen Whyte! If you're interested to adopt her, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and tell me about yourself especially your dog ownership experience and do expect an interview.",8079e3a1c-8.jpg,Miniature_Pinscher,False
