    "# Sentiment analysis with BOW representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is a machine learning technique that assigns a set of predefined categories to open-ended text. Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much any kind of text – from documents, medical studies and files, and all over the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, new articles can be organized by topics; support tickets can be organized by urgency; chat conversations can be organized by language; brand mentions can be organized by sentiment; and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications such as **sentiment analysis**, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Text Classification Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s estimated that around 80% of all information is unstructured, with text being one of the most common types of unstructured data. Because of the messy nature of text, analyzing, understanding, organizing, and sorting through text data is hard and time-consuming, so most companies fail to use it to its full potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where text classification with machine learning comes in. Using text classifiers, companies can automatically structure all manner of relevant text, from emails, legal documents, social media, chatbots, surveys, and more in a fast and cost-effective way. This allows companies to save time analyzing text data, automate business processes, and make data-driven business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Does Text Classification Work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on manually crafted rules, machine learning text classification learns to make classifications based on past observations. By using pre-labeled examples as training data, machine learning algorithms can learn the different associations between pieces of text, and that a particular output (i.e., tags) is expected for a particular input (i.e., text). A “tag” is the pre-determined classification or category that any given text could fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step towards training a machine learning NLP classifier is feature extraction: a method is used to transform each text into a numerical representation in the form of a vector. One of the most frequently used approaches is bag of words, where a vector represents the frequency of a word in a predefined dictionary of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the machine learning algorithm is fed with training data that consists of pairs of feature sets (vectors for each text example) and tags (e.g. sports, politics) to produce a classification model:\n",
    "\n",
    "![training](https://monkeylearn.com/static/507a7b5d0557f416857a038f553865d1/2ed04/text_process_training.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it’s trained with enough training samples, the machine learning model can begin to make accurate predictions. The same feature extractor is used to transform unseen text to feature sets, which can be fed into the classification model to get predictions on tags (e.g., sports, politics):\n",
    "\n",
    "![prediction](https://monkeylearn.com/static/afa7e0536886ee7152dfa4c628fe59f0/2b924/text_process_prediction.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification with machine learning is usually much more accurate than human-crafted rule systems, especially on complex NLP classification tasks. Also, classifiers with machine learning are easier to maintain and you can always tag new examples to learn new tasks."
