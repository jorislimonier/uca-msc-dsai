% Evaluation: Write a brief report in which you provide your own view of the challenge of "Learning Without Data Collections". The report can be based on my book entitled "DEEP LEARNING TO SEE - Towards New Foundations of Computer Vision" and on both my two lectures. In particular you could organized you report as follows:

% 1. Brief discussion on actual contexts in which  the view of  "Learning Without Data Collections" can take place.
% 2. Critical comments on the notion of motion invariance. In particular, provide a perspective on strengths and weakness in the process of feature extraction
% 3. Find one-two articles that you consider related to the covered topic and underline the similarities.

% AI are really good (performance), but really bad (computational cost)
