\maketitle

\section{Unknown vocabulary}
Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network,

\section{Paper goal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To describe data with non-fixed categories (current SOTA has fixed label but too restrictive)
    \item Get large descriptions rather than one sentenced-ones
    \item Make a model that is free of assumptions
\end{itemize}

\section{Current challenges}
Many labeled datasets available but several mentions of the same categories from one dataset to another (hard to go and change labels to have a coherent dataset)

\section{Solutions offered in the paper}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make weak labels from multiple datasets to associate labels from multiple datasets
    \item Multimodal RNN with input an image, output text description
\end{itemize}

\section{Achievements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SOTA performances on image-ranking experiments.
    \item Outperforms retrieval baselines on both fullframes and region-level experoments (beats )
\end{itemize}
