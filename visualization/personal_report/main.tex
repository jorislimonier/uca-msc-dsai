\subsubsection*{The informal description of the processing of the raw data in order to make it to fit in the visualization technique. This might include calculated variables you must add in the process.}
Clustering Artist - \textit{type} variable to make \textit{is\_band} boolean variable


\subsubsection*{The name of visualization technique and the name of the member of the group who is going to implement it. Associate the visualization technique with the visual goal.}
